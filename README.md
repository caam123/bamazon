# Bamazon CLI APP - Customer View

In this activit I created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, node.js and Inquirer npm package. Te info is displayed in the CLI (Command Line Interface.

**This exercise includes (so far) the Customer view**

* A list of products available is displayed and then the app aks you what you'd like to buy
* Buy typing the id and the quantity of the product you can complete your purchase. If there are no items available, you start the process over again.
* It also asks if you want to order anything else, if so it will display de info again, otherwise, ends the purchase and thanks you for the visit.
* Enjoy!
